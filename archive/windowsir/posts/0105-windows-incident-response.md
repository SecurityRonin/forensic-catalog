Windows Incident Response
 The Windows Incident Response Blog is dedicated to the myriad information surrounding and inherent to the topics of IR and digital analysis of Windows systems. This blog provides information in support of my books; "Windows Forensic Analysis" (1st thru 4th editions), "Windows Registry Forensics",
as well as the book I co-authored with Cory Altheide, "Digital Forensics with Open Source Tools".

 There Are Four Lights: Shell Items

 The DOSDate time stamps within the shell items, particularly for resources located on the system itself, were originally stored within the MFT as FILETIME objects.  What this means is that we have a significant loss in granularity, going from 64-bits based on 100-nanosecond intervals, to 32-bits with the seconds multiplied times 2.  If the seconds value for the original FILETIME time stamp is 5, then what's stored in the DOSDate format is 10...and a difference of 5 seconds can be significant, particularly in timeline analysis, and if you don't know enough about the data structures to explain it.
 Systems from Vista on up do not, by default, update last accessed times through normal user activity, such as opening files.
 Target resources listed in shellbags can be modified by activity and processes outside the purview of the shellbags artifacts.

 LNK files
 Jump Lists (both auto* and custom*, on both Win7 and 8)
 Shellbags
 MeunOrder subkeys
 ComDlg32 subkey values (Vista+)
 Windows 8 USRCLASS.DAT ( Photos artifacts )

 Thank you for this very useful post, Harlan. Do you know why some systems (XP) have the itempos, and why some others (still XP) haven't got ?

 Cheers :-)
 I assume with a lot of examiners out there, our work load is overwhelming to the point of overlooking some important items. I appreciate the time, effort and knowledge you have put into this. There is so much to be learned still on windows artifacts and I rely on others research to further my knowledge on the the subject.
 Anonymous,

 Understood. This is why I posted the information, so that you and others would be aware of it.
 Also of interest are the Explorer\Streams, which (in at least XP) provide file names. The date stamps also are indicated. No path\folders, but file names.

 I believe that the key relates to column settings in Explorer. Offhand, do you know whether the Explorer\Streams reports files only on removable media? I looked at a couple of Win 7 systems and didn't see the key, at least not with similar data.
 Thanks for the great post Harlan, very helpful!
 Great post, thank you. Regarding links to the external blog posts ("LNK Parsing: You’re doing it wrong"), the author has since changed his blog and those links are dead. Here are the working URLs:

 Thanks again,

 Adam
